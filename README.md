Installation:

b.Upload the extension
Copy the folder "marc1706" included in the downloaded .ZIP file to the folder ext of your phpBB forum.
After having copied the folder you must see the folder ext/marc1706/quickedit in your phpBB directory.

c. Enable the extension
Login to your phpBB administration contral panel (ACP) and open the Customise tab. Then look for the QuickEdit extension and click on the Enable link to activate it.

d. Clear your phpBB cache
phpBB features a cache system that creates static copies of the used files. One of the most common reasons that something doesn't work or a change isn't reflected is because your phpBB is displaying an old, cached version of a changed file.

Login to your phpBB administration contral panel (ACP) and on the index page of that area, you will see your Board statistics. Below that is an area titled Resynchronise or reset statistics. This area features a series of Run now buttons. Press the button next to Purge the cache, confirm your decision and your cache will be refreshed.
